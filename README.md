## What is Crown?

Crown is both a leading digital token (known as CRW) and a self-sustainable blockchain platform for building and running economy applications. Our community uses the Crown Platform as a payment service, proof of data integrity and a support structure for projects ranging from cloud businesses to apps. As more users lend their talents and passion to the platform, Crown’s potential to promote innovation grows exponentially. 

###  A Digital Token

CRW tokens are a type of cryptocurrency. Like bitcoins, CRW can be used to pay for a wide variety of products and services. CRW can also be traded against other altcoins through an online exchange.

### Blockchain Application Platform

The Crown Platform utilizes two additional tiers of nodes that offer different roles: Masternodes process instant transactions while Systemnodes will host applications via the CrownPlatform. Members of the Crown Community can set up their own incentivized nodes to earn CRW while helping to maintain the network.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version Crown see http://crown.tech/wallet.

## Community

Crown is ultimately a community-driven platform. Its potential to bring social and echnological growth is contingent on the ideas and support its users provide. We invite you to lend your voice and imagination to this burgeoning platform and share in its success. Together, there’s no limit to what we can accomplish.

## Governance

Crown’s governance system has two core functions: choosing platform direction and funding. Unlike blockchain projects that rely on donations and pre-mined endowments, Crown uses 10% of each block reward to fund its own development. This allocation of funds allows us to reward miners and node operators for their contributions without compromising the platform’s coding and optimization efforts.

Crown’s governance system also enables its community to vote on which changes (ranging from projects to network updates) will be implemented onto the blockchain. Any platform user can submit a proposal to grow or change the network.

## Server Nodes

Crown uses two types of server nodes to build and protect its network — Systemnodes and Masternodes. Each of these dedicated servers are unique and provide vital infrastructure. By creating and running them, you can help our community grow while consistently earning Crown tokens as a reward. Here’s a brief description of each:

### Masternodes

Masternodes supply substantial computing power to the Crown Platform, and have copies of the ledger stored and ready to distribute to the network if needed. Think of Masternodes as the stabilizing force behind Crown; they help us keep the network secure and running smoothly by tracking the ledger and confirming transactions at lightning speed with Instant Send. A Masternode requires 10,000 CRW collateral to run.

### Systemnodes

Systemnodes are empty-shell servers that are tasked with hosting specific services for the Crown network other than transaction verification. The Crown Platform will use Systemnodes to host new economy applications created by members of the community, connecting them to the Crown Platform through an API. A Systemnode requires 500 CRW collateral to run. 

## Development

### Report a bug

Bugs can be reported via the github issues page: https://github.com/Crowndev/crowncoin/issues, tech support channel in [Mattermost](https://mm.crownlab.eu/crown/channels/tech-support) or emailing [support@crown.tech](email:support@crown.tech)

### Procedures for bounty development
The Crown team will  post a request for development and the requirements to receive the bounty reward and the size of the reward. 

1. Developers at large can then post their interest in seeking the bounty on github and being developing on the change.
2. Once the at-large developer deems his code complete, they will submit a pull request via ionomy github with the label of the Bounty Feature.
3. It will then be reviewed and tested by the internal development team at ionomy.com.
4. After initial code inspection and internal testing the update will be deployed to the testnet.
5. A minimum of 15 days of testnet function per upgrade is required to fully validate and test the upgrade.
6. Once tested and validated, the pull request will be merged to master code and included in the next update.
7. When the version update is deployed Bounty funds will be released to the developer of the completed feature.
