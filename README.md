## What is Crown?

Crown is both a leading digital token (known as CRW) and a self-sustainable blockchain platform for building and running economy applications. Our community uses the Crown Platform as a payment service, proof of data integrity and a support structure for projects ranging from cloud businesses to apps. As more users lend their talents and passion to the platform, Crown’s potential to promote innovation grows exponentially. 

###  A Digital Token

CRW tokens are a type of cryptocurrency. Like bitcoins, CRW can be used to pay for a wide variety of products and services. CRW can also be traded against other altcoins through an online exchange.

### Blockchain Application Platform

The Crown Platform utilizes secure servers (incentivized nodes) to provide scalability and fault-tolerance for economy applications. Members of the Crown Community can set up their own incentivized nodes to earn CRW while helping to maintain the network.
