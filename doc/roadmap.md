# CROWN PRODUCT ROADMAP - Summer 2018
## CORE UPGRADES
Bringing in all useful features, enhancements, bug fixes, and performance improvements from the bitcoin core codebase. Some of these include:
- Compiler updates
- Memory performance improvements
- Block and transaction handling
- Build system updates
- Unit tests
- Transaction malleability, fee sniping and other potential vulnerabilities fixes
- Bitcoin Scripting language upgrade
- P2P and network protocol optimization
- Wallet improvements (ex. All transactions will use Instant Send)
## GOVERNANCE
The voting system that funds community proposals and network development. New features, new voting nodes, and more!
- Moving unspent proposal funds to the next budget
- Implement new Systemnode voting ability
- Bug fixes
- In-wallet proposal notifications
## PROGRESSIVELY EVOLVING CONSENSUS
The part of the network that provides agreement on the order and validity of transactions is the consensus algorithm. Crown is currently secured by Proof-of-Work (PoW) through Bitcoin SHA256 merge-mining, which is Phase 1 of the process to a more energy-efficient form of network agreement and security. Phase 2 is the switch from PoW to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Phase 3 is the implementation of a newer algorithm that is currently being researched and developed.
- Migrate network to the PoS algorithm
- Increase node incentives for Masternodes and Systemnodes
- Test and implement new algorithm once R&D and testnet auditing are complete
- Contracts Notarization
## REGISTRATION
To become a provider in the Crown ecosystem, an application service must be registered in the Crown blockchain. For this goal, Crown Platform will provide registration agents and other infrastructure.
- Community Delegated Agents
- Services Registration
- Identity Verification
## API
The Crown Platform API will be an access point for transacting on the network. With this implementation, network businesses and service providers will have programmatic access to the blockchain, providing easy hookup to user ID verification and payment mechanisms. Developers will be able to program dApps in any language and enable features of the Crown blockchain right in their code!
- RPC updates
- REST implementation
- Services payment hooks
- Registration system integration
## DATA STORAGE
Decentralized file storage integration like Storj, filecoin, using IPFS or another file system designed for encrypted peer-to-peer distribution.
- dApps hosted on Crown Platform will be able to securely store and distribute files
