C.	Bug fixes
D.	In-wallet proposal notifications
3.	PROGRESSIVELY EVOLVING CONSENSUS
The part of the network that provides agreement on the order and validity of transactions is the consensus algorithm. Crown is currently secured by Proof-of-Work (PoW) through Bitcoin SHA256 merge-mining, which is Phase 1 of the process to a more energy-efficient form of network agreement and security. Phase 2 is the switch from PoW to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Phase 3 is the implementation of a newer algorithm that is currently being researched and developed.
A.	Migrate network to the PoS algorithm
B.	Increase node incentives for Masternodes and Systemnodes
C.	Test and implement new algorithm once R&D and testnet auditing are complete
D.	Contracts Notarization
